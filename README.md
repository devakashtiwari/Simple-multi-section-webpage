Web-Technologies-PBL---1-Year-Semester-II-Assignment-2

# Develop a simple multi-section webpage and identify which parts belong to the client and which to the server in the client-server architecture. 

📝 Project Description

This project is a visual and interactive demonstration of Client–Server Architecture using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It explains how modern web applications are structured by clearly separating **client-side , server-side, and client–server interaction components.

The project is designed for students and beginners to understand where different web technologies run and how data flows between the browser and the server.

An interactive demo simulates HTTP requests and server responses to make the learning experience more practical and engaging.
